               causal inferences on the effect of an exposure (risk factor) on
               an outcome from observational data. It has gained in popularity
               over the past decade with the use of genetic variants as
               instrumental variables, known as Mendelian randomization. An
               instrumental variable is associated with the exposure, but not
               associated with any confounder of the exposure?outcome
               association, nor is there any causal pathway from the
               instrumental variable to the outcome other than via the
               exposure. Under the assumption that a single instrumental
               variable or a set of instrumental variables for the exposure is
               available, the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome can
               be estimated. There are several methods available for
               instrumental variable estimation; we consider the ratio method,

  title    = "Mendelian randomization with invalid instruments: effect
              estimation and bias detection through Egger regression",
  author   = "Bowden, Jack and Davey Smith, George and Burgess, Stephen",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses
              including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly
              increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide
              association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise
              estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may
              not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them
              having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).
              METHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple
              instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by
              pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias.
              Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually
              by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression,
              a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be
              adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope
              coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the
              causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each
              genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the
              pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's
              test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a
              consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic
              variants are invalid instrumental variables. RESULTS: We
              illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published
              Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on
              lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on
              coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this
              approach is illustrated with these examples. CONCLUSIONS: An
              adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect
              some violations of the standard instrumental variable
              assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject
              to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis
              for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization
              investigation.",

  abstract = "Inference about the causal structure that induces correlations
              between two traits can be achieved by combining genetic
              associations with a mediation-based approach, as is done in the
              causal inference test (CIT). However, we show that measurement
              error in the phenotypes can lead to the CIT inferring the wrong
              causal direction, and that increasing sample sizes has the
              adverse effect of increasing confidence in the wrong answer. This
              problem is likely to be general to other mediation-based
              approaches. Here we introduce an extension to Mendelian
              randomisation, a method that uses genetic associations in an
              instrumentation framework, that enables inference of the causal
              direction between traits, with some advantages. First, it can be
              performed using only summary level data from genome-wide
              association studies; second, it is less susceptible to bias in
              the presence of measurement error or unmeasured confounding. We
              apply the method to infer the causal direction between DNA
              methylation and gene expression levels. Our results demonstrate
              that, in general, DNA methylation is more likely to be the causal
              factor, but this result is highly susceptible to bias induced by
              systematic differences in measurement error between the
              platforms, and by horizontal pleiotropy. We emphasise that, where
              possible, implementing MR and appropriate sensitivity analyses

              triangulate reliable conclusions about causality.",

  abstract = "Recent advances in the causal inference literature on mediation
              have extended traditional approaches to direct and indirect
              effects to settings that allow for interactions and
              non-linearities. In this paper, these approaches from causal
              inference are further extended to settings in which multiple
              mediators may be of interest. Two analytic approaches, one based
              on regression and one based on weighting are proposed to estimate
              the effect mediated through multiple mediators and the effects
              through other pathways. The approaches proposed here accommodate
              exposure-mediator interactions and, to a certain extent,
              mediator-mediator interactions as well. The methods handle binary
              or continuous mediators and binary, continuous or count outcomes.
              When the mediators affect one another, the strategy of trying to
              assess direct and indirect effects one mediator at a time will in
              general fail; the approach given in this paper can still be used.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Mendelian randomization is used to test and estimate
              the magnitude of a causal effect of a phenotype on an outcome by
              using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs). Estimates
              of association from IV analysis are biased in the direction of
              the confounded, observational association between phenotype and
              outcome. The magnitude of the bias depends on the F-statistic for
              the strength of relationship between IVs and phenotype. We seek
              to develop guidelines for the design and analysis of Mendelian
              randomization studies to minimize bias. METHODS: IV analysis was
              performed on simulated and real data to investigate the effect on
              bias of size of study, number and choice of instruments and
              method of analysis. RESULTS: Bias is shown to increase as the
              expected F-statistic decreases, and can be reduced by using
              parsimonious models of genetic association (i.e. not
              over-parameterized) and by adjusting for measured covariates.
              Using data from a single study, the causal estimate of a unit
              increase in log-transformed C-reactive protein on fibrinogen
              ($\mu$mol/l) is shown to increase from -0.005 (P = 0.99) to 0.792
              (P = 0.00003) due to injudicious choice of instrument. Moreover,
              when the observed F-statistic is larger than expected in a
              particular study, the causal estimate is more biased towards the
              observational association and its standard error is smaller. This
              correlation between causal estimate and standard error introduces
              a second source of bias into meta-analysis of Mendelian
              randomization studies. Bias can be alleviated in meta-analyses by
              using individual level data and by pooling genetic effects across
              studies. CONCLUSIONS: Weak instrument bias is of practical
              importance for the design and analysis of Mendelian randomization
              studies. Post hoc choice of instruments, genetic models or data
              based on measured F-statistics can exacerbate bias. In
              particular, the commonly cited rule of thumb that F > 10 avoids
              bias in IV analysis is misleading.",

              Based on functional annotation, these loci included genes
              encoding surface markers of myeloid, lymphoid, or hematopoietic
              stem cell differentiation (CD69, CD33, CD87), transcription

  abstract = "Motivation: Epidemiological cohorts typically contain a diverse
              set of phenotypes such that automation of phenome scans is
              non-trivial, because they require highly heterogeneous models.
              For this reason, phenome scans have to date tended to use a
              smaller homogeneous set of phenotypes that can be analysed in a
              consistent fashion. We present PHESANT (PHEnome Scan ANalysis
              Tool), a software package for performing comprehensive phenome
              scans in UK Biobank. General features: PHESANT tests the
              association of a specified trait with all continuous, integer and
              categorical variables in UK Biobank, or a specified subset.
              PHESANT uses a novel rule-based algorithm to determine how to
              appropriately test each trait, then performs the analyses and
              produces plots and summary tables. Implementation: The PHESANT
              phenome scan is implemented in R. PHESANT includes a novel
              Javascript D3.js visualization and accompanying Java code that
              converts the phenome scan results to the required JavaScript
              Object Notation (JSON) format. Availability: PHESANT is available

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous
              associations between genetic loci and individual phenotypes;
              however, relatively few GWAS have attempted to detect pleiotropic
              associations, in which loci are simultaneously associated with
              multiple distinct phenotypes. We show that pleiotropic
              associations can be directly modeled via the construction of
              simple Bayesian networks, and that these models can be applied to
              produce single or ensembles of Bayesian classifiers that leverage
              pleiotropy to improve genetic risk prediction. The proposed
              method includes two phases: (1) Bayesian model comparison, to
              identify Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with
              one or more traits; and (2) cross-validation feature selection,
              in which a final set of SNPs is selected to optimize prediction.
              To demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the method, a
              total of 1600 case-control GWAS datasets with two dichotomous
              phenotypes were simulated under 16 scenarios, varying the
              association strengths of causal SNPs, the size of the discovery
              sets, the balance between cases and controls, and the number of
              pleiotropic causal SNPs. Across the 16 scenarios, prediction
              accuracy varied from 90 to 50\%. In the 14 scenarios that
              included pleiotropically associated SNPs, the pleiotropic model
              search and prediction methods consistently outperformed the naive
              model search and prediction. In the two scenarios in which there
              were no true pleiotropic SNPs, the differences between the
              pleiotropic and naive model searches were minimal. To further
              evaluate the method on real data, a discovery set of 1071 sickle
              cell disease (SCD) patients was used to search for pleiotropic
              associations between cerebral vascular accidents and fetal
              hemoglobin level. Classification was performed on a smaller
              validation set of 352 SCD patients, and showed that the inclusion
              of pleiotropic SNPs may slightly improve prediction, although the
              difference was not statistically significant. The proposed method
              is robust, computationally efficient, and provides a powerful new

              variables to obtain causal inferences from observational data.
              Two recent developments for combining information on multiple
              uncorrelated instrumental variables (IVs) into a single causal
              estimate are as follows: (i) allele scores, in which
              individual-level data on the IVs are aggregated into a univariate
              score, which is used as a single IV, and (ii) a summary statistic
              method, in which causal estimates calculated from each IV using
              summarized data are combined in an inverse-variance weighted
              meta-analysis. To avoid bias from weak instruments, unweighted
              and externally weighted allele scores have been recommended.
              Here, we propose equivalent approaches using summarized data and
              also provide extensions of the methods for use with correlated
              IVs. We investigate the impact of different choices of weights on
              the bias and precision of estimates in simulation studies. We
              show that allele score estimates can be reproduced using
              summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor and
              the outcome. Estimates from the summary statistic method using
              external weights are biased towards the null when the weights are
              imprecisely estimated; in contrast, allele score estimates are
              unbiased. With equal or external weights, both methods provide
              appropriate tests of the null hypothesis of no causal effect even
              with large numbers of potentially weak instruments. We illustrate
              these methods using summarized data on the causal effect of
              low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on coronary heart disease
              risk. It is shown that a more precise causal estimate can be
              obtained using multiple genetic variants from a single gene
              region, even if the variants are correlated.",

              complication is that any given rare variant could have no effect,

              variance rather than the mean, maintains consistent power when
              the target set contains both risk and protective variants.

              (GWAS) have been applied to aid in the understanding of the
              biology of traits. The success of this approach is governed by
              the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and
              the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given
              the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous
              ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci;
              however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to
              identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR)
              <1.15). METHODS: We conducted a large-scale coordinated
              international collaboration to combine independent genotyping
              data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery
              of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a
              discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by
              meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets
              (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308
              controls). RESULTS: We observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that
              overlaps several genes includingPITX3, which encodes a
              transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal
              differentiation andCUEDC2previously reported to be associated
              with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also
              observe overlap with regions previously implicated in
              schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic
              correlation between these disorders (Rg = 0.23;P = 9 $\times$
              10-6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
              (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to
              identify additional regions which may be important in a common
              neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci.
              These include loci previously implicated in ASD such asFOXP1at
              3p13,ATP2B2at 3p25.3, and a 'neurodevelopmental hub' on
              chromosome 8p11.23. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an important step
              in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the
              common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we
              have identified a significant genetic correlation with
              schizophrenia and association of ASD with several

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies, which typically report
              regression coefficients summarizing the associations of many
              genetic variants with various traits, are potentially a powerful
              source of data for Mendelian randomization investigations. We
              demonstrate how such coefficients from multiple variants can be
              combined in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the
              causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome. The bias and
              efficiency of estimates based on summarized data are compared to
              those based on individual-level data in simulation studies. We
              investigate the impact of gene-gene interactions, linkage
              disequilibrium, and 'weak instruments' on these estimates. Both
              an inverse-variance weighted average of variant-specific
              associations and a likelihood-based approach for summarized data
              give similar estimates and precision to the two-stage least
              squares method for individual-level data, even when there are
              gene-gene interactions. However, these summarized data methods
              overstate precision when variants are in linkage disequilibrium.
              If the P-value in a linear regression of the risk factor for each
              variant is less than 1$\times$10⁻⁵, then weak instrument bias
              will be small. We use these methods to estimate the causal
              association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on
              coronary artery disease using published data on five genetic
              variants. A 30\% reduction in LDL-C is estimated to reduce
              coronary artery disease risk by 67\% (95\% CI: 54\% to 76\%). We
              conclude that Mendelian randomization investigations using
              summarized data from uncorrelated variants are similarly
              efficient to those using individual-level data, although the
              necessary assumptions cannot be so fully assessed.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample
              size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were
              later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple
              test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results
              when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed
              the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. DESIGN:
              Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis
              and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if
              effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate
              was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37
              meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading
              general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the
              second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
              MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured
              by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates
              against precision. RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis
              and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular
              medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric
              medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant
              and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to
              meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was
              present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of
              concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%)
              Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was
              bias. CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a
              useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but
              as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses
              are based on a limited number of small trials the results from
              such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.",

              genome-wide association studies of mental health in the US
              military contributed participants. The New Soldier Study (NSS)
              included 3167 unique participants with PTSD and 4607
              trauma-exposed control individuals; the Pre/Post Deployment Study
              (PPDS) included 947 unique participants with PTSD and 4969
              trauma-exposed controls. The NSS data were collected from
              February 1, 2011, to November 30, 2012; the PDDS data, from
              January 9 to April 30, 2012. The primary analysis compared
              lifetime DSM-IV PTSD cases with trauma-exposed controls without
              lifetime PTSD. Data were analyzed from March 18 to December 27,
              2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association analyses for PTSD
              used logistic regression models within each of 3 ancestral groups
              (European, African, and Latino American) by study, followed by
              meta-analysis. Heritability and genetic correlation and
              pleiotropy with other psychiatric and immune-related disorders
              were estimated. RESULTS: The NSS population was 80.7\% male (6277
              of 7774 participants; mean [SD] age, 20.9 [3.3] years); the PPDS
              population, 94.4\% male (5583 of 5916 participants; mean [SD]
              age, 26.5 [6.0] years). A genome-wide significant locus was found
              in ANKRD55 on chromosome 5 (rs159572; odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95\%
              CI, 1.37-1.92; P = 2.34 $\times$ 10-8) and persisted after
              adjustment for cumulative trauma exposure (adjusted OR, 1.64;
              95\% CI, 1.39-1.95; P = 1.18 $\times$ 10-8) in the African
              American samples from the NSS. A genome-wide significant locus
              was also found in or near ZNF626 on chromosome 19 (rs11085374;
              OR, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.70-0.85; P = 4.59 $\times$ 10-8) in the
              European American samples from the NSS. Similar results were not
              found for either single-nucleotide polymorphism in the
              corresponding ancestry group from the PPDS sample, in other
              ancestral groups, or in transancestral meta-analyses.
              Single-nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability was
              nonsignificant, and no significant genetic correlations were
              observed between PTSD and 6 mental disorders or 9 immune-related
              disorders. Significant evidence of pleiotropy was observed
              between PTSD and rheumatoid arthritis and, to a lesser extent,
              psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the largest genome-wide
              association study of PTSD to date, involving a US military
              sample, limited evidence of association for specific loci was
              found. Further efforts are needed to replicate the genome-wide
              significant association with ANKRD55-associated in prior research
              with several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders-and to clarify
              the nature of the genetic overlap observed between PTSD and
              rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.",

              and to identify risk loci for PTSD. Examining 20 730 individuals,

              h2SNPfor schizophrenia and is substantially higher than h2SNPin
              European-American males (estimate not distinguishable from zero).
              We found strong evidence of overlapping genetic risk between PTSD

              widely used in genetics applications, including, recently,
              polygenic modeling in genome-wide association studies. These two
              approaches make very different assumptions, so are expected to
              perform well in different situations. However, in practice, for a
              given dataset one typically does not know which assumptions will
              be more accurate. Motivated by this, we consider a hybrid of the
              two, which we refer to as a ``Bayesian sparse linear mixed
              model'' (BSLMM) that includes both these models as special cases.
              We address several key computational and statistical issues that
              arise when applying BSLMM, including appropriate prior
              specification for the hyper-parameters and a novel Markov chain
              Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. We apply BSLMM and
              compare it with other methods for two polygenic modeling
              applications: estimating the proportion of variance in phenotypes
              explained (PVE) by available genotypes, and phenotype (or
              breeding value) prediction. For PVE estimation, we demonstrate
              that BSLMM combines the advantages of both standard LMMs and
              sparse regression modeling. For phenotype prediction it
              considerably outperforms either of the other two methods, as well

              variants in a single gene region any of which could be used to
              assess this causal relationship. However, using too many genetic
              variants in the analysis can lead to spurious estimates and

              are used, then the majority of the data is ignored and estimates
              are highly sensitive to the particular choice of variants. We
              propose an approach based on summarized data only (genetic
              association and correlation estimates) that uses principal
              components analysis to form instruments. This approach has
              desirable theoretical properties: it takes the totality of data
              into account and does not suffer from numerical instabilities. It
              also has good properties in simulation studies: it is not

              not have greatly inflated Type 1 error rates. Overall, the method

              pruning approach to select variants), but are more robust to
              seemingly arbitrary choices in the variable selection step.

              used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies.
              Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a
              variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies
              (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary
              data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to
              the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method,
              recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger
              and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the
              instrumental variable assumptions. Methods: Here, a new method -
              the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single
              causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE
              is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in
              infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates
              comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments
              are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in
              simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data
              setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal
              effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary
              heart disease risk. Results: The MBE presented less bias and
              lower type-I error rates than other methods under the null in
              many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller
              compared with the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger
              than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements
              typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia.
              Conclusions: The MBE relaxes the instrumental variable
              assumptions, and should be used in combination with other
              approaches in sensitivity analyses.",

              dementia with more than 35 million people affected worldwide, and
              no curative treatment available. AD is highly heritable and
              recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified over 20 genomic
              loci associated with AD, yet only explaining a small proportion
              of the genetic variance indicating that undiscovered loci exist.
              Here, we performed the largest genome-wide association study of
              clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 AD cases, 383,378
              controls). AD-by-proxy status is based on parental AD diagnosis,
              and showed strong genetic correlation with AD (rg=0.81). Genetic
              meta-analysis identified 29 risk loci, of which 9 are novel, and
              implicating 215 potential causative genes. Independent
              replication further supports these novel loci in AD. Associated
              genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell
              types (spleen, liver and microglia). Furthermore, gene-set
              analyses indicate the genetic contribution of biological
              mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of
              amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations

              randomisation results suggest a protective effect of cognitive
              ability on AD risk. These results are a step forward in
              identifying more of the genetic factors that contribute to AD
              risk and add novel insights into the neurobiology of AD to guide
              new drug development.",

               information over sets of related genes, such as genes in common
               pathways, to identify gene sets that are enriched for variants
               associated with disease. We develop a model-based approach to
               pathway analysis, and apply this approach to data from the
               Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) studies. Our
               method offers several benefits over existing approaches. First,
               our method not only interrogates pathways for enrichment of
               disease associations, but also estimates the level of
               enrichment, which yields a coherent way to promote variants in
               enriched pathways, enhancing discovery of genes underlying
               disease. Second, our approach allows for multiple enriched
               pathways, a feature that leads to novel findings in two diseases
               where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a major
               determinant of disease susceptibility. Third, by modeling
               disease as the combined effect of multiple markers, our method
               automatically accounts for linkage disequilibrium among
               variants. Interrogation of pathways from eight pathway databases
               yields strong support for enriched pathways, indicating links
               between Crohn's disease (CD) and cytokine-driven networks that
               modulate immune responses; between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
               ``Measles'' pathway genes involved in immune responses triggered
               by measles infection; and between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and
               IL2-mediated signaling genes. Prioritizing variants in these
               enriched pathways yields many additional putative disease
               associations compared to analyses without enrichment. For CD and
               RA, 7 of 8 additional non-MHC associations are corroborated by
               other studies, providing validation for our approach. For T1D,
               prioritization of IL-2 signaling genes yields strong evidence
               for 7 additional non-MHC candidate disease loci, as well as
               suggestive evidence for several more. Of the 7 strongest
               associations, 4 are validated by other studies, and 3 (near IL-2
               signaling genes RAF1, MAPK14, and FYN) constitute novel putative
               T1D loci for further study.",

               well-established results of biometry in accordance with the
               Mendelian scheme of inheritance. It is here attempted to
               ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more
               general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in
               which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will
               be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human
               variability. The great body of available statistics show us that
               the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very
               closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the
               variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation
               corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When
               there are two independent causes of variability capable of
               producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with
               standard deviations $\sigma$1 and $\sigma$2, it is found that
               the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard
               deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of
               variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as
               the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the
               Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may
               now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages
               of the total variance which they together produce. It is
               desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis
               of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood,
               and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that
               loose phrases about the ``percentage of causation,'' which

              their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25

              Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas
              neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and
              from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant
              sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes,

              progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), we tested their association
              with brain gene expression, CpG methylation and neuropathology.
              In 175 autopsied PSP subjects, we performed associations between
              seven PSP risk variants and temporal cortex levels of 20 genes
              in-cis, within $\pm$100 kb. Methylation measures were collected
              using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing in 43 PSP
              brains. To determine whether SNP/expression associations are due
              to epigenetic modifications, CpG methylation levels of associated
              genes were tested against relevant variants. Quantitative
              neuropathology endophenotypes were tested for SNP associations in
              422 PSP subjects. Brain levels of LRRC37A4 and ARL17B were
              associated with rs8070723; MOBP with rs1768208 and both ARL17A
              and ARL17B with rs242557. Expression associations for LRRC37A4
              and MOBP were available in an additional 100 PSP subjects.
              Meta-analysis revealed highly significant associations for PSP
              risk alleles of rs8070723 and rs1768208 with higher LRRC37A4 and
              MOBP brain levels, respectively. Methylation levels of one CpG in
              the 3' region of ARL17B associated with rs242557 and rs8070723.
              Additionally, methylation levels of an intronic ARL17A CpG
              associated with rs242557 and that of an intronic MOBP CpG with
              rs1768208. MAPT and MOBP region risk alleles also associated with
              higher levels of neuropathology. Strongest associations were
              observed for rs242557/coiled bodies and tufted astrocytes; and
              for rs1768208/coiled bodies and tau threads. These findings
              suggest that PSP variants at MAPT and MOBP loci may confer PSP
              risk via influencing gene expression and tau neuropathology.
              MOBP, LRRC37A4, ARL17A and ARL17B warrant further assessment as
              candidate PSP risk genes. Our findings have implications for the

              cognitive functions in patients with psychotic illness. Evidence
              suggests that among patients with psychosis there is a distinct
              heritable neurophysiologic phenotypic subtype captured by
              impairments across a range of ERP measures. In this study, we
              investigated the genetic basis of this ``globally impaired'' ERP
              cluster and its relationship to psychosis and cognitive
              abilities. We applied K-means clustering to six ERP measures to
              re-derive the globally impaired (n = 60) and the non-globally
              impaired ERP clusters (n = 323) in a sample of cases with
              schizophrenia (SCZ = 136) or bipolar disorder (BPD = 121) and
              healthy controls (n = 126). We used genome-wide association study
              (GWAS) results for SCZ, BPD, college completion, and childhood
              intelligence as the discovery datasets to derive polygenic risk
              scores (PRS) in our study sample and tested their associations
              with globally impaired ERP. We conducted mediation analyses to
              estimate the proportion of each PRS effect on severity of
              psychotic symptoms that is mediated through membership in the
              globally impaired ERP. Individuals with globally impaired ERP had
              significantly higher PANSS-positive scores ($\beta$ = 3.95, P =
              0.005). The SCZ-PRS was nominally associated with globally
              impaired ERP (unadjusted P = 0.01; R2 = 3.07\%). We also found a
              significant positive association between the college-PRS and
              globally impaired ERP (FDR-corrected P = 0.004; R2 = 6.15\%). The
              effect of college-PRS on PANSS positivity was almost entirely
              (97.1\%) mediated through globally impaired ERP. These results
              suggest that the globally impaired ERP phenotype may represent
              some aspects of brain physiology on the path between genetic
              influences on educational attainment and psychotic symptoms.",

  abstract = "In genetics, pleiotropy describes the genetic effect of a single
              gene on multiple phenotypic traits. A common approach is to
              analyze the phenotypic traits separately using univariate
              analyses and combine the test results through multiple
              comparisons. This approach may lead to low power. Multivariate
              functional linear models are developed to connect genetic variant
              data to multiple quantitative traits adjusting for covariates for
              a unified analysis. Three types of approximate F-distribution
              tests based on Pillai-Bartlett trace, Hotelling-Lawley trace, and
              Wilks's Lambda are introduced to test for association between
              multiple quantitative traits and multiple genetic variants in one
              genetic region. The approximate F-distribution tests provide much
              more significant results than those of F-tests of univariate
              analysis and optimal sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O).
              Extensive simulations were performed to evaluate the false
              positive rates and power performance of the proposed models and
              tests. We show that the approximate F-distribution tests control
              the type I error rates very well. Overall, simultaneous analysis
              of multiple traits can increase power performance compared to an
              individual test of each trait. The proposed methods were applied
              to analyze (1) four lipid traits in eight European cohorts, and
              (2) three biochemical traits in the Trinity Students Study. The
              approximate F-distribution tests provide much more significant
              results than those of F-tests of univariate analysis and SKAT-O
              for the three biochemical traits. The approximate F-distribution
              tests of the proposed functional linear models are more sensitive
              than those of the traditional multivariate linear models that in
              turn are more sensitive than SKAT-O in the univariate case. The
              analysis of the four lipid traits and the three biochemical
              traits detects more association than SKAT-O in the univariate
              case.",

              GWAS findings of various traits in the past decade reveal many
              examples of this phenomenon, suggesting the wide existence of
              pleiotropic effects. What underlies this phenomenon is the
              biological connection among seemingly unrelated traits/diseases.
              Characterizing the molecular mechanisms of pleiotropy not only
              helps to explain the relationship between diseases, but may also
              contribute to novel insights concerning the pathological
              mechanism of each specific disease, leading to better disease
              prevention, diagnosis and treatment. However, most pleiotropic
              effects remain elusive because their functional roles have not

              representing four major racial/ethnic groups (European Americans
              (EA), African Americans (AA), Hispanics/Mexican-Americans, and
              Asian/Pacific Islanders) in PAGE, each site with measurements for
              multiple traits, associated laboratory measures, and intermediate
              biomarkers. A total of 83 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
              identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were
              genotyped across two or more PAGE study sites. Comprehensive
              tests of association, stratified by race/ethnicity, were
              performed, encompassing 4,706 phenotypes mapped to 105
              phenotype-classes, and association results were compared across
              study sites. A total of 111 PheWAS results had significant
              associations for two or more PAGE study sites with consistent
              direction of effect with a significance threshold of p<0.01 for
              the same racial/ethnic group, SNP, and phenotype-class. Among
              results identified for SNPs previously associated with phenotypes
              such as lipid traits, type 2 diabetes, and body mass index, 52
              replicated previously published genotype-phenotype associations,

              novel genotype-phenotype associations with pleiotropic effects.
              The majority of the potentially novel results were for single
              PheWAS phenotype-classes, for example, for CDKN2A/B rs1333049
              (previously associated with type 2 diabetes in EA) a PheWAS
              association was identified for hemoglobin levels in AA. Of note,

               tested for association with all available phenotypes and traits
               that have been measured in study participants. By investigating
               the relationship between genetic variation and a diversity of

               can expose pleiotropy, provide novel mechanistic insights, and
               foster hypothesis generation. This approach is complementary to
               genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that test the association

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with vitamin D deficiency, and
              both are areas of active public health concern. We explored the
              causality and direction of the relationship between body mass
              index (BMI) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] using genetic
              markers as instrumental variables (IVs) in bi-directional
              Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
              used information from 21 adult cohorts (up to 42,024
              participants) with 12 BMI-related SNPs (combined in an allelic
              score) to produce an instrument for BMI and four SNPs associated
              with 25(OH)D (combined in two allelic scores, separately for
              genes encoding its synthesis or metabolism) as an instrument for
              vitamin D. Regression estimates for the IVs (allele scores) were
              generated within-study and pooled by meta-analysis to generate
              summary effects. Associations between vitamin D scores and BMI
              were confirmed in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric
              Traits (GIANT) consortium (n = 123,864). Each 1 kg/m(2) higher
              BMI was associated with 1.15\% lower 25(OH)D (p =
              6.52$\times$10⁻²⁷). The BMI allele score was associated both with
              BMI (p = 6.30$\times$10⁻⁶²) and 25(OH)D (-0.06\% [95\% CI -0.10
              to -0.02], p = 0.004) in the cohorts that underwent
              meta-analysis. The two vitamin D allele scores were strongly
              associated with 25(OH)D (p$\leq$8.07$\times$10⁻⁵⁷ for both
              scores) but not with BMI (synthesis score, p = 0.88; metabolism
              score, p = 0.08) in the meta-analysis. A 10\% higher genetically
              instrumented BMI was associated with 4.2\% lower 25(OH)D
              concentrations (IV ratio: -4.2 [95\% CI -7.1 to -1.3], p =
              0.005). No association was seen for genetically instrumented
              25(OH)D with BMI, a finding that was confirmed using data from
              the GIANT consortium (p$\geq$0.57 for both vitamin D scores).
              CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a bi-directional genetic approach
              that limits confounding, our study suggests that a higher BMI
              leads to lower 25(OH)D, while any effects of lower 25(OH)D
              increasing BMI are likely to be small. Population level
              interventions to reduce BMI are expected to decrease the
              prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.",

              studies have been published for human traits adjusted for other
              correlated traits with a genetic basis. In most studies, the
              motivation for such an adjustment is to discover genetic variants
              associated with the primary outcome independently of the
              correlated trait. In this report, we contend that this objective
              is fulfilled when the tested variants have no effect on the
              covariate or when the correlation between the covariate and the
              outcome is fully explained by a direct effect of the covariate on
              the outcome. For all other scenarios, an unintended bias is
              introduced with respect to the primary outcome as a result of the
              adjustment, and this bias might lead to false positives. Here, we
              illustrate this point by providing examples from published
              genome-wide association studies, including large meta-analysis of
              waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference adjusted for body mass
              index (BMI), where genetic effects might be biased as a result of
              adjustment for body mass index. Using both theory and
              simulations, we explore this phenomenon in detail and discuss the

               causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous
               concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications
               in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics,
               philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social
               sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic,
               manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to
               causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the
               relationships between causal connections and statistical
               associations. The book will open the way for including causal
               analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial
               intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and
               economics. Students in these fields will find natural models,
               simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
               definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have
               evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of
               Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that
               causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer
               science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000
               scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists
               from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this
               revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers
               readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent
               advances in this field of research. Causality will be of
               interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of
               fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships
               from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess

              (AdIL-1beta), a proinflammatory cytokine, induces marked

              This is associated with an increase in TGF-beta1 concentration in
              bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. TGF-beta1 is a key cytokine
              in the process of fibrogenesis, using intracellular signaling
              pathways involving Smad2 and Smad3. In this study we investigate
              whether inflammation induced by IL-1beta is able to independently
              induce lung fibrosis in mice deficient in the Smad3 gene. Seven
              days after AdIL-1beta administration, similar levels of IL-1beta
              transgene are seen in BAL in both wild-type (WT) and knockout
              (KO) mice, and BAL cell profiles demonstrated a similar marked
              neutrophilic inflammation. Phospho-Smad2 staining was positive in
              areas of inflammation in both WT and KO mice at day 7. By day 35
              after transient IL-1beta expression, WT mice showed marked
              fibrosis in peribronchial areas, quantified by picrosirius red
              staining and morphometry. However, there was no evidence of
              fibrosis or collagen accumulation in IL-1beta-treated KO mice,
              and peribronchial areas were not different from KO mice treated
              with the control adenovector. TGF-beta1 and phospho-Smad2 were
              strongly positive at day 35 in fibrotic areas observed in WT

              IL-1beta-induced chronic fibrotic response in mouse lungs is
              dependent on Smad3. KO and WT animals demonstrated a similar
              inflammatory response to overexpression of IL-1beta indicating
              that inflammation must link to the Smad3 pathway, likely through

              patients with chronic disease such as chronic renal failure.
              Inflammation and malnutrition both reduce albumin concentration
              by decreasing its rate of synthesis, while inflammation alone is
              associated with a greater fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and,
              when extreme, increased transfer of albumin out of the vascular
              compartment. A vicious cascade of events ensues in which
              inflammation induces anorexia and reduces the effective use of
              dietary protein and energy intake and augments catabolism of the
              key somatic protein, albumin. Hypoalbuminemia is a powerful
              predictor of mortality in patients with chronic renal failure,
              and the major cause of death in this population is due to
              cardiovascular events. Inflammation is associated with vascular

              events in a number of tissues, including the nervous system. One
              such POU protein, SCIP, is expressed by Schwann cells in a
              tightly delimited developmental window termed promyelination. In
              the PNS, promyelination is functionally defined as the period
              following Schwann cell exit from the cell-cycle, but prior to the
              onset of myelination. Previous transgenic and gene ablation
              studies have shown that SCIP is a myelin-competence factor in the
              Schwann cell, where it is required for entry into, and the
              subsequent maintenance of promyelination. To further understand
              the molecular biology of the promyelination-to-myelination
              transition in the Schwann cell, we have undertaken a series of
              DDRTPCR studies to identify genes that are expressed during this

              POU gene, Brn-5, the expression of which has not previously been

              developmental expression patterns of Brn-5 and SCIP are inverse,
              with Brn-5 stably expressed in the adult myelinating Schwann
              cell, but virtually absent during promyelination. Further, we
              show that the induction of the two genes is independent, with
              SCIP induction requiring activation of adenyl cyclase, whereas
              Brn-5 induction requires only GGF2. In addition, the induction of
              Brn-5 is exquisitely sensitive to neuregulin concentration, with
              higher levels inhibiting its expression. Following nerve injury,
              when GGF2 levels are elevated in the distal nerve, Brn-5
              expression disappears, and SCIP is reexpressed.",

              instrumental variable (IV) for higher BMI. In 8,156 women of
              European descent from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort, height was
              measured at age 39-77 years; age at menarche was self-recalled,
              as was body weight at age 20 years, and BMI at 20 was calculated
              as a proxy for childhood BMI. DNA was genotyped for twelve
              BMI-associated common variants (in/near FTO, MC4R, TMEM18,
              GNPDA2, KCTD15, NEGR1, BDNF, ETV5, MTCH2, SEC16B, FAIM2 and

              boost power to detect novel disease loci or pinpoint the
              susceptibility gene at a known disease locus. However, it is
              often the case that multiple eQTL genes colocalize at disease
              loci, making the identification of the true susceptibility gene
              challenging, due to confounding through linkage disequilibrium
              (LD). To distinguish between true susceptibility genes (where the
              genetic effect on phenotype is mediated through expression) and
              colocalization due to LD, we examine an extension of the
              Mendelian randomization (MR) egger regression method that allows
              for LD while only requiring summary association data for both
              GWAS and eQTL. We derive the standard TWAS approach in the
              context of MR and show in simulations that the standard TWAS does
              not control type I error for causal gene identification when
              eQTLs have pleiotropic or LD-confounded effects on disease. In
              contrast, LD-aware MR-Egger (LDA MR-Egger) regression can control
              type I error in this case while attaining similar power as other
              methods in situations where these provide valid tests. However,
              when the direct effects of genetic variants on traits are
              correlated with the eQTL associations, all of the methods we
              examined including LDA MR-Egger regression can have inflated type
              I error. We illustrate these methods by integrating gene
              expression within a recent large-scale breast cancer GWAS to
              provide guidance on susceptibility gene identification.",

  abstract = "Genetic correlation is a key population parameter that describes
              the shared genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases.
              It can be estimated by current state-of-art methods, i.e.,
              linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and genomic
              restricted maximum likelihood (GREML). The massively reduced
              computing burden of LDSC compared to GREML makes it an attractive
              tool, although the accuracy (i.e., magnitude of standard errors)
              of LDSC estimates has not been thoroughly studied. In simulation,
              we show that the accuracy of GREML is generally higher than that
              of LDSC. When there is genetic heterogeneity between the actual
              sample and reference data from which LD scores are estimated, the
              accuracy of LDSC decreases further. In real data analyses
              estimating the genetic correlation between schizophrenia (SCZ)
              and body mass index, we show that GREML estimates based on
              ∼150,000 individuals give a higher accuracy than LDSC estimates
              based on ∼400,000 individuals (from combined meta-data). A GREML
              genomic partitioning analysis reveals that the genetic
              correlation between SCZ and height is significantly negative for
              regulatory regions, which whole genome or LDSC approach has less
              power to detect. We conclude that LDSC estimates should be
              carefully interpreted as there can be uncertainty about
              homogeneity among combined meta-datasets. We suggest that any
              interesting findings from massive LDSC analysis for a large
              number of complex traits should be followed up, where possible,
              with more detailed analyses with GREML methods, even if sample

  abstract = "We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in
              linear regression, and to quantifying uncertainty in selected
              variables. The approach is based on a new model -- the ``Sum of
              Single Effects'' (SuSiE) model -- which comes from writing the
              sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of
              ``single-effect'' vectors, each with one non-zero element. We
              also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure -- Iterative
              Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) -- which is a Bayesian
              analogue of traditional stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares
              the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise
              methods, but instead of selecting a single variable at each step,
              IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures
              uncertainty in which variable to select. We show that the IBSS
              algorithm computes a variational approximation to the posterior
              distribution under the SuSiE model. Further, this approximate
              posterior distribution naturally leads to a convenient, novel,
              way to summarize uncertainty in variable selection, and provides
              a Credible Set for each selected variable. Our methods are
              particularly well suited to settings where variables are highly
              correlated and true effects are very sparse, both of which are
              characteristics of genetic fine-mapping applications. We
              demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods
              outperform existing methods for this task, and illustrate the
              methods by fine-mapping genetic variants that influence
              alternative splicing in human cell-lines. We also discuss both
              the potential and the challenges for applying these methods to
              generic variable selection problems.",

              synthetic processes, but the degree of regulation attributed to
              genes and environmental factors affecting normal variation
              remains controversial. DESIGN: We investigated the magnitude of
              the genetic and environmental determination of serum
              concentrations of free (f) T3, fT4, TSH and the fT4 x TSH product
              and their variation, in a large cohort of twin pairs. Female
              dizygous and monozygous twins (849 and 213 pairs, respectively)
              from the TwinsUK registry (mean age 45.5, range 18-80 years) were
              studied. RESULTS: Comparison of thyroid parameters within various
              groups showed no differences between smoking categories, and
              higher serum TSH and lower fT3 in subjects with positive thyroid
              antibodies. Using structural equation modelling, we estimated the
              heritable contribution to serum thyroid parameters (with 95\%
              confidence intervals) to be 65\% (58\%-71\%) for TSH, 65\%
              (58\%-71\%) for the fT4 x TSH product, 39\% (20\%-55\%) for fT4
              and 23\% (3\%-41\%) for fT3. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
              genetic regulation is a particularly important determinant of TSH
              and the fT4 x TSH product, and is a less important determinant of
              fT4 and fT3 concentrations in Caucasian women. These data from a
              large well-characterized cohort suggest that while there is a
              strong heritable contribution to serum TSH, variation in fT4 and
              fT3 concentrations may be less explained by genetic factors and
              more driven by environmental effects than previously thought.",

               of self-reported healthy twin pairs was identified through the

               and environmental factors on the variation of these hormone

               influence. In quantitative genetic modeling, the heritability

              causality of associations between exposures and disease outcomes
              using data on genetic determinants of the exposure. In this work,
              we explore the effect of exposure and outcome measurement error
              in MR studies. METHODS: For continuous traits, we describe
              measurement error in terms of a theoretical regression of the
              measured variable on the true variable. We quantify error in
              terms of the slope (calibration) and the R(2) values
              (discrimination or classical measurement error). We simulated
              cohort data sets under realistic parameters and used two-stage
              least squares regression to assess the effect of measurement
              error for continuous exposures and outcomes on bias, precision
              and power. For simulations of binary outcomes, we varied
              sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Discrimination error in
              continuous exposures and outcomes did not bias the MR estimate,
              and only outcome discrimination error substantially reduced
              power. Calibration error biased the MR estimate when the exposure
              and the outcome measures were not calibrated in a similar
              fashion, but power was not affected. For binary outcomes,
              exposure calibration error introduced substantial bias (with
              negligible impact on power), but exposure discrimination error
              did not. Reduced outcome specificity and, to a lesser degree,
              reduced sensitivity biased MR estimates towards the null.
              CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the potential effects of measurement
              error is an important consideration when interpreting estimates
              from MR analyses. Based on these results, future MR studies

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Current data suggest that proprotein
              convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors may affect
              many metabolic pathways beyond lowering LDL cholesterol. The aim
              of the present manuscript is to present these so-called
              pleiotropic effects of PCSK9 inhibitors. RECENT FINDINGS: PCSK9
              may affect the activity of other receptors beyond LDL receptors
              (LDLR), such as cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36),
              very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) receptors, apolipoprotein
              (Apo) E receptors, LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP-1) and ATP-Binding
              Cassette Transporter (ABCA1). Thus, a role of PCSK9 in the
              development of atherosclerosis, in vascular wall inflammation and
              in platelet function has been suggested. Additionally, PCSK9
              inhibitors may affect lipid variables beyond LDL cholesterol,
              carbohydrate variables, as well as they may affect brain and
              kidney function. Additionally, a controversial role of PCSK9 in
              sepsis, hepatitis C infection and Alzheimer's disease has been
              suggested. SUMMARY: These possible pleiotropic effects of PCSK9
              inhibitors need further research, as they may affect

              hundreds of human diseases and traits, revealing important
              biological pathways and defining novel therapeutic hypotheses.
              However, the genes discovered to date typically explain less than
              half of the apparent heritability. Because efforts have largely
              focused on common genetic variants, one hypothesis is that much
              of the missing heritability is due to rare genetic variants.
              Studies of common variants are typically referred to as
              genomewide association studies, whereas studies of rare variants
              are often simply called sequencing studies. Because they are
              actually closely related, we use the terms common variant
              association study (CVAS) and rare variant association study
              (RVAS). In this paper, we outline the similarities and
              differences between RVAS and CVAS and describe a conceptual
              framework for the design of RVAS. We apply the framework to
              address key questions about the sample sizes needed to detect
              association, the relative merits of testing disruptive alleles
              vs. missense alleles, frequency thresholds for filtering alleles,
              the value of predictors of the functional impact of missense
              alleles, the potential utility of isolated populations, the value
              of gene-set analysis, and the utility of de novo mutations. The
              optimal design depends critically on the selection coefficient
              against deleterious alleles and thus varies across genes. The
              analysis shows that common variant and rare variant studies
              require similarly large sample collections. In particular, a
              well-powered RVAS should involve discovery sets with at least
              25,000 cases, together with a substantial replication set.",

              substantial heritability and is two to seven times more common in
              male individuals than in female individuals. We examined two
              putative genetic mechanisms underlying this sex bias:
              sex-specific heterogeneity and higher burden of risk in female
              cases. METHODS: We analyzed genome-wide autosomal common variants
              from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and iPSYCH Project (n =
              20,183 cases, n = 35,191 controls) and Swedish population
              register data (n = 77,905 cases, n = 1,874,637 population
              controls). RESULTS: Genetic correlation analyses using two
              methods suggested near complete sharing of common variant effects
              across sexes, with rg estimates close to 1. Analyses of
              population data, however, indicated that female individuals with
              ADHD may be at especially high risk for certain comorbid
              developmental conditions (i.e., autism spectrum disorder and
              congenital malformations), potentially indicating some clinical
              and etiological heterogeneity. Polygenic risk score analysis did
              not support a higher burden of ADHD common risk variants in
              female cases (odds ratio [confidence interval] = 1.02
              [0.98-1.06], p = .28). In contrast, epidemiological sibling
              analyses revealed that the siblings of female individuals with
              ADHD are at higher familial risk for ADHD than the siblings of
              affected male individuals (odds ratio [confidence interval] =
              1.14 [1.11-1.18], p = 1.5E-15). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study
              supports a greater familial burden of risk in female individuals
              with ADHD and some clinical and etiological heterogeneity, based
              on epidemiological analyses. However, molecular genetic analyses
              suggest that autosomal common variants largely do not explain the

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Although twin and family studies have shown
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to be highly
              heritable, genetic variants influencing the trait at a
              genome-wide significant level have yet to be identified. As prior
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not yielded
              significant results, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing
              studies to boost statistical power. METHOD: We used data from
              four projects: a) the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP);
              b) phase I of the International Multicenter ADHD Genetics project
              (IMAGE); c) phase II of IMAGE (IMAGE II); and d) the
              Pfizer-funded study from the University of California, Los
              Angeles, Washington University, and Massachusetts General
              Hospital (PUWMa). The final sample size consisted of 2,064 trios,
              896 cases, and 2,455 controls. For each study, we imputed HapMap
              single nucleotide polymorphisms, computed association test
              statistics and transformed them to z-scores, and then combined
              weighted z-scores in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: No genome-wide
              significant associations were found, although an analysis of
              candidate genes suggests that they may be involved in the
              disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Given that ADHD is a highly heritable
              disorder, our negative results suggest that the effects of common
              ADHD risk variants must, individually, be very small or that
              other types of variants, e.g., rare ones, account for much of the
              disorder's heritability.",

              Genetics Collaborative (IOCDF-GC) and the OCD Collaborative
              Genetics Association Study (OCGAS), but many of the top-ranked
              signals were supported in only one study. We therefore conducted
              a meta-analysis from the two consortia, investigating a total of
              2688 individuals of European ancestry with OCD and 7037
              genomically matched controls. No single-nucleotide polymorphisms
              (SNPs) reached genome-wide significance. However, in comparison
              with the two individual GWASs, the distribution of P-values
              shifted toward significance. The top haplotypic blocks were
              tagged with rs4733767 (P=7.1 $\times$ 10-7; odds ratio (OR)=1.21;
              confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.31, CASC8/CASC11), rs1030757

              the phenotypic variance in OCGAS and the European IOCDF-GC target
              samples, respectively. The common SNP heritability in the
              combined OCGAS and IOCDF-GC sample was estimated to be 0.28

              moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis
              of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the
              assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages
              used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of
              all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have
              been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances
              are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the
              Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which
              subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides
              a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and

              for genetic variants that contribute to human diseases. It has
              long been known that such studies may suffer from high rates of
              false positives if there is unrecognized population structure. It
              is perhaps less widely appreciated that so-called ``cryptic
              relatedness'' (i.e., kinship among the cases or controls that is
              not known to the investigator) might also potentially inflate the
              false positive rate. Until now there has been little work to
              assess how serious this problem is likely to be in practice. In
              this paper, we develop a formal model of cryptic relatedness, and
              study its impact on association studies. We provide simple
              expressions that predict the extent of confounding due to cryptic
              relatedness. Surprisingly, these expressions are functions of
              directly observable parameters. Our analytical results show that,
              for well-designed studies in outbred populations, the degree of
              confounding due to cryptic relatedness will usually be
              negligible. However, in contrast, studies where there is a
              sampling bias toward collecting relatives may indeed suffer from
              excessive rates of false positives. Furthermore, cryptic
              relatedness may be a serious concern in founder populations that
              have grown rapidly and recently from a small size. As an example,

  abstract = "Humans vary substantially in their willingness to take risks. In
              a combined sample of over one million individuals, we conducted
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of general risk tolerance,
              adventurousness, and risky behaviors in the driving, drinking,
              smoking, and sexual domains. We identified 611 approximately
              independent genetic loci associated with at least one of our
              phenotypes, including 124 with general risk tolerance. We report
              evidence of substantial shared genetic influences across general
              risk tolerance and risky behaviors: 72 of the 124 general risk
              tolerance loci contain a lead SNP for at least one of our other
              GWAS, and general risk tolerance is moderately to strongly
              genetically correlated (|rˆg| ~ 0.25 to 0.50) with a range of
              risky behaviors. Bioinformatics analyses imply that genes near
              general-risk-tolerance-associated SNPs are highly expressed in
              brain tissues and point to a role for glutamatergic and GABAergic
              neurotransmission. We find no evidence of enrichment for genes
              previously hypothesized to relate to risk tolerance.",

  abstract = "The field of phenomics has been investigating network structure
              among large arrays of phenotypes, and genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS) have been used to investigate the relationship
              between genetic variation and single diseases/outcomes. A novel
              approach has emerged combining both the exploration of phenotypic
              structure and genotypic variation, known as the phenome-wide
              association study (PheWAS). The Population Architecture using
              Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) network is a National Human
              Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)-supported collaboration of four
              groups accessing eight extensively characterized epidemiologic
              studies. The primary focus of PAGE is deep characterization of
              well-replicated GWAS variants and their relationships to various
              phenotypes and traits in diverse epidemiologic studies that
              include European Americans, African Americans, Mexican
              Americans/Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and Native
              Americans. The rich phenotypic resources of PAGE studies provide
              a unique opportunity for PheWAS as each genotyped variant can be
              tested for an association with the wide array of phenotypic
              measurements available within the studies of PAGE, including
              prevalent and incident status for multiple common clinical
              conditions and risk factors, as well as clinical parameters and
              intermediate biomarkers. The results of PheWAS can be used to
              discover novel relationships between SNPs, phenotypes, and
              networks of interrelated phenotypes; identify pleiotropy; provide
              novel mechanistic insights; and foster hypothesis generation. The
              PAGE network has developed infrastructure to support and perform
              PheWAS in a high-throughput manner. As implementing the PheWAS
              approach has presented several challenges, the infrastructure and
              methodology, as well as insights gained in this project, are
              presented herein to benefit the larger scientific community.",

               The causes and genetic consequences of assortative mating remain
               un­re­solved because partner similarity can arise from different
               mechanisms: phenotypic assortment based on mate choice15,16,
               partner interaction and convergence in phenotype over time14,17,
               or social homogamy where individuals pair according to social or
               environmental background. Here, we present theory and an
               analytical approach to test for genetic evidence of assortative
               mating and find a correlation in genetic value among partners
               for a range of phenotypes. Across three independent samples of
               24,662 spousal pairs in total, we infer a correlation at
               trait-associated loci between partners for height (0.200, 0.004
               standard error, SE) that matched the phenotypic correlation

               for BMI (0.143, 0.007 SE) that was significantly lower than the
               phenotypic value (0.228, 0.004 SE). We extend our analysis to
               the UK Biobank study (7,780 pairs), finding evidence of a
               correlation at trait-associated loci for waist-to-hip ratio

  title     = "`Mendelian randomization': can genetic epidemiology contribute
               to understanding environmental determinants of disease?",
  author    = "Davey Smith, George and Ebrahim, Shah",
  abstract  = "Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in
               observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus
               misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and
               analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization---the random
               assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during
               gamete formation and conception---provides one method for
               assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The
               association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the
               biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not
               generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding
               that may distort interpretations of conventional observational
               studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of
               polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence
               of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are
               described. The limitations of the approach include confounding
               by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism
               under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic
               effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable
               polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and
               canalization---the buffering of the effects of genetic variation
               during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization
               provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates
               how investment in the human genome project may contribute to
               understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health
               of modifiable exposures.Genetic epidemiology---the theme of this
               issue of the International Journal of Epidemiology---is seen by
               many to be the only future for epidemiology, perhaps reflecting
               a growing awareness of the limitations of observational
               epidemiology1 (Box 1). Genetic epidemiology is concerned with
               understanding heritable aspects of disease risk, individual
               susceptibility to disease, and ultimately with contributing to a
               comprehensive molecular understanding of pathogenesis. The
               massive investment and expansion of human genetics, if it is to
               return value for the common good, must be integrated into public
               health functions. The human genome epidemiology network (HuGE
               Net---http://www.cdc.gov/genetics/huge.htm) has been established
               to promote the use of genetic knowledge---in terms of genetic
               tests and services---for disease prevention and health
               promotion.2,3 A broad taxonomy of human genome studies of public
               health relevance has been developed4 (Box 2). In this issue of
               the IJE, we publish a paper by Miguel Porta,5 who highlights the
               need for a more rational approach to genetic testing, given the
               likely low penetrance of many genes associated with cancers,6
               likening the role of the genome to a jazz score that is
               interpreted and developed through experience and context---and
               is seldom predictable. Such insights may well temper enthusiasm
               for genetic testing in populations. However, in parallel to the
               approaches advocated by HuGE, genetic epidemiology can lead to a
               more robust understanding of environmental determinants of
               disease (e.g. dietary factors, occupational exposures, and
               health-related behaviours) relevant to whole populations (and
               not simply to genetically susceptible sub-populations).7--10
               This approach has recently been referred to as `Mendelian
               randomization'.11--15 Here we begin by briefly reviewing reasons
               for current concerns about aetiological findings generated by
               conventional observational epidemiology and then we outline the
               potential contribution (and limitations) of Mendelian
               randomization.Box 1 Nature announces a genetic epidemiology

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified thousands of
              variants associated with complex traits, but their biological
              interpretation often remains unclear. Most of these variants
              overlap with expression QTLs (eQTLs), indicating their potential
              involvement in the regulation of gene expression. Here, we
              propose an advanced summary statistics-based Mendelian
              Randomization approach that uses multiple SNPs jointly as
              instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures,
              simultaneously. When applied to 43 human phenotypes it uncovered
              2,277 putative genes whose blood expression is causally
              associated with at least one phenotype resulting in 5,009
              gene-trait associations; of note, 55\% of them had no genome-wide
              significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS analysis. Using
              independent association summary statistics (UKBiobank), we
              confirmed that the majority of these loci were missed by
              conventional GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these
              novel links are height- and intelligence-associated PEX19 and
              CDC42, respectively known to carry mutations leading to short
              stature and Takenouchi-Kosaki syndrome. We similarly unraveled
              novel pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic
              connections, e.g. the shared genetic effects of TSPAN14 in
              rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn9s and inflammatory bowel disease.
              Finally, we show that causal genes can be highly tissue-specific.
              Our advanced Mendelian Randomization unlocks hidden value from
              published GWAS through higher power in detecting associations. It
              better accounts for pleiotropy and unravels new biological
              mechanisms underlying complex and clinical traits.",

              thousands of risk loci for many complex traits and diseases, the
              causal variants and genes at these loci remain largely unknown.
              Here, we introduce a method for estimating the local genetic
              correlation between gene expression and a complex trait and
              utilize it to estimate the genetic correlation due to predicted
              expression between pairs of traits. We integrated gene expression
              measurements from 45 expression panels with summary GWAS data to
              perform 30 multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies
              (TWASs). We identified 1,196 genes whose expression is associated
              with these traits; of these, 168 reside more than 0.5 Mb away
              from any previously reported GWAS significant variant. We then
              used our approach to find 43 pairs of traits with significant
              genetic correlation at the level of predicted expression; of
              these, eight were not found through genetic correlation at the

  title     = "{Bayesian Variable Selection in Linear Regression}",
  author    = "Mitchell, T J and Beauchamp, J J",
  abstract  = "Abstract This article is concerned with the selection of subsets
               of predictor variables in a linear regression model for the
               prediction of a dependent variable. It is based on a Bayesian
               approach, intended to be as objective as possible. A probability
               distribution is first assigned to the dependent variable through
               the specification of a family of prior distributions for the
               unknown parameters in the regression model. The method is not
               fully Bayesian, however, because the ultimate choice of prior
               distribution from this family is affected by the data. It is
               assumed that the predictors represent distinct observables; the
               corresponding regression coefficients are assigned independent
               prior distributions. For each regression coefficient subject to
               deletion from the model, the prior distribution is a mixture of
               a point mass at 0 and a diffuse uniform distribution elsewhere,
               that is, a ?spike and slab? distribution. The random error
               component is assigned a normal distribution with mean 0 and
               standard deviation $\sigma$, where ln($\sigma$) has a locally
               uniform noninformative prior distribution. The appropriate
               posterior probabilities are derived for each submodel. If the
               regression coefficients have identical priors, the posterior
               distribution depends only on the data and the parameter ?, which
               is the height of the spike divided by the height of the slab for
               the common prior distribution. This parameter is not assigned a
               probability distribution; instead, it is considered a parameter
               that indexes the members of a class of Bayesian methods.
               Graphical methods are proposed as informal guides for choosing
               ?, assessing the complexity of the response function and the
               strength of the individual predictor variables, and assessing
               the degree of uncertainty about the best submodel. The following
               plots against ? are suggested: (a) posterior probability that a
               particular regression coefficient is 0; (b) posterior expected
               number of terms in the model; (c) posterior entropy of the
               submodel distribution; (d) posterior predictive error; and (e)
               posterior probability of goodness of fit. Plots (d) and (e) are
               suggested as ways to choose y. The predictive error is
               determined using a Bayesian cross-validation approach that
               generates a predictive density for each observation, given all
               of the data except that observation, that is, a type of ?leave
               one out? approach. The goodness-of-fit measure is the sum of the
               posterior probabilities of all submodels that pass a standard F
               test for goodness of fit relative to the full model, at a
               specified level of significance. The dependence of the results
               on the scaling of the variables is discussed, and some ways to
               choose the scaling constants are suggested. Examples based on a
               large data set arising from an energy-conservation study are
               given to demonstrate the application of the methods.",

               was diagnosed. The relation is probably not explained by diet,
               because in the Seven Countries Study cohorts with widely
               different diets and corresponding differences in mean
               cholesterol levels experienced similar mean cancer rates.2,3 On
               the other hand, within each region cancer incidence was higher

               application of the C-alpha statistic to test these rare
               variants. C-alpha aims to determine whether the set of variants
               observed in cases and controls is a mixture, such that some of
               the variants confer risk or protection or are phenotypically

               protective variants more common in controls. C-alpha is

               better understanding of the causal structure of the variables
               involved in the analysis, with a formal definition of direct and
               indirect effects in a counterfactual framework, alternative
               analytical methods have been introduced to improve the validity
               and interpretation of mediation analysis. In this paper, we
               review and discuss the impact of the three main sources of
               potential bias in the traditional approach to mediation
               analyses: (i) mediator-outcome confounding;(ii)
               exposure-mediator interaction and (iii) mediator-outcome
               confounding affected by the exposure. We provide examples and
               discuss the impact these sources have in terms of bias.",

  abstract  = "A conventional Mendelian randomization analysis assesses the
               causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome by using genetic
               variants that are solely associated with the risk factor of
               interest as instrumental variables. However, in some cases, such
               as the case of triglyceride level as a risk factor for
               cardiovascular disease, it may be difficult to find a relevant
               genetic variant that is not also associated with related risk
               factors, such as other lipid fractions. Such a variant is known
               as pleiotropic. In this paper, we propose an extension of
               Mendelian randomization that uses multiple genetic variants

               estimate the causal effect of each of the risk factors on the

               is similar to the simultaneous assessment of several treatments

               identify disease-relevant genomic regions, but interpretation of
               the data is challenging. The FTO region harbors the strongest
               genetic association with obesity, yet the mechanistic basis of
               this association remains elusive. METHODS: We examined
               epigenomic data, allelic activity, motif conservation, regulator
               expression, and gene coexpression patterns, with the aim of
               dissecting the regulatory circuitry and mechanistic basis of the
               association between the FTO region and obesity. We validated our
               predictions with the use of directed perturbations in samples
               from patients and from mice and with endogenous CRISPR-Cas9
               genome editing in samples from patients. RESULTS: Our data
               indicate that the FTO allele associated with obesity represses
               mitochondrial thermogenesis in adipocyte precursor cells in a
               tissue-autonomous manner. The rs1421085 T-to-C single-nucleotide
               variant disrupts a conserved motif for the ARID5B repressor,
               which leads to derepression of a potent preadipocyte enhancer
               and a doubling of IRX3 and IRX5 expression during early
               adipocyte differentiation. This results in a cell-autonomous
               developmental shift from energy-dissipating beige (brite)
               adipocytes to energy-storing white adipocytes, with a reduction
               in mitochondrial thermogenesis by a factor of 5, as well as an
               increase in lipid storage. Inhibition of Irx3 in adipose tissue
               in mice reduced body weight and increased energy dissipation
               without a change in physical activity or appetite. Knockdown of
               IRX3 or IRX5 in primary adipocytes from participants with the
               risk allele restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of
               7, and overexpression of these genes had the opposite effect in
               adipocytes from nonrisk-allele carriers. Repair of the ARID5B
               motif by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of rs1421085 in primary adipocytes
               from a patient with the risk allele restored IRX3 and IRX5
               repression, activated browning expression programs, and restored
               thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7. CONCLUSIONS: Our
               results point to a pathway for adipocyte thermogenesis
               regulation involving ARID5B, rs1421085, IRX3, and IRX5, which,
               when manipulated, had pronounced pro-obesity and anti-obesity

               to test for directional pleiotropy and provides an estimate of
               the causal effect adjusted for its presence. MR-Egger regression
               provides a useful additional sensitivity analysis to the
               standard inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach that assumes
               all variants are valid instruments. Both methods use weights
               that consider the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-exposure
               associations to be known, rather than estimated. We call this
               the `NO Measurement Error' (NOME) assumption. Causal effect
               estimates from the IVW approach exhibit weak instrument bias
               whenever the genetic variants utilized violate the NOME
               assumption, which can be reliably measured using the
               F-statistic. The effect of NOME violation on MR-Egger regression
               has yet to be studied. Methods: An adaptation of the I2
               statistic from the field of meta-analysis is proposed to
               quantify the strength of NOME violation for MR-Egger. It lies
               between 0 and 1, and indicates the expected relative bias (or
               dilution) of the MR-Egger causal estimate in the two-sample MR
               context. We call it IGX2 . The method of simulation
               extrapolation is also explored to counteract the dilution. Their
               joint utility is evaluated using simulated data and applied to a
               real MR example. Results: In simulated two-sample MR analyses we
               show that, when a causal effect exists, the MR-Egger estimate of
               causal effect is biased towards the null when NOME is violated,
               and the stronger the violation (as indicated by lower values of
               IGX2 ), the stronger the dilution. When additionally all genetic
               variants are valid instruments, the type I error rate of the
               MR-Egger test for pleiotropy is inflated and the causal effect
               underestimated. Simulation extrapolation is shown to
               substantially mitigate these adverse effects. We demonstrate our
               proposed approach for a two-sample summary data MR analysis to
               estimate the causal effect of low-density lipoprotein on heart
               disease risk. A high value of IGX2 close to 1 indicates that
               dilution does not materially affect the standard MR-Egger
               analyses for these data. Conclusions: : Care must be taken to
               assess the NOME assumption via the IGX2 statistic before
               implementing standard MR-Egger regression in the two-sample
               summary data context. If IGX2 is sufficiently low (less than
               90\%), inferences from the method should be interpreted with
               caution and adjustment methods considered.",

               population differentiation to detect selection and enables an
               analysis of the UK population structure at fine resolution. In
               this study, analyses of 113,851 UK Biobank samples showed that
               population structure in the UK is dominated by five principal
               components (PCs) spanning six clusters: Northern Ireland,
               Scotland, northern England, southern England, and two Welsh
               clusters. Analyses of ancient Eurasians revealed that
               populations in the northern UK have higher levels of Steppe
               ancestry and that UK population structure cannot be explained as
               a simple mixture of Celts and Saxons. A scan for unusual

               of the causal effect. While conventional analysis methods for

               able to assess whether genetic variants have pleiotropic effects

  abstract  = "We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale
               hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates
               (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences
               from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that
               the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal,
               with a mode at 0. This ``unimodal assumption'' (UA), although
               natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into
               standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it
               brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient
               and robust computation-estimating the unimodal distribution
               involves solving a simple convex optimization problem-and
               enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second,
               the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an
               effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather
               than the one number usually used ($p$ value or $z$ score). When
               available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for
               variation in measurement precision across tests. It also
               facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR
               methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible
               regions) for each effect in addition to measures of
               significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and
               significance measures, we introduce the term ``local false sign
               rate'' to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an
               effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of
               significance than the local FDR because it is both more
               generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated. Our

               complex disease risk and will become more accurate as training
               sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating
               risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker
               pruning and applying a p value threshold to association
               statistics, but this discards information and can reduce
               predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers
               the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior
               on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference
               panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the
               approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at
               large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R(2) increased from
               20.1\% to 25.3\% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8\%
               to 12.0\% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar
               relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three
               additional large disease datasets and for non-European
               schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing
               methods will grow as sample sizes increase.",

               mediation analysis techniques when the standard approaches will
               not work. They extend definitions of controlled direct effects
               and natural direct and indirect effects from the risk difference
               scale to the odds ratio scale. A simple technique to estimate
               direct and indirect effect odds ratios by combining logistic and

               rare and the mediator continuous. Further discussion is given as
               to how this mediation analysis technique can be extended to
               settings in which data come from a case-control study design.
               For the standard mediation analysis techniques used in the

               discover the coordinated control of these traits via genotyped
               polymorphisms. A common statistical approach to this problem
               involves assessing the relationship between each phenotype and
               each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) individually (PHN);
               and taking a Bonferroni correction for the effective number of
               independent tests conducted. Alternatively, one can apply a
               dimension reduction technique, such as estimation of principal
               components, and test for an association with the principal
               components of the phenotypes (PCP) rather than the individual
               phenotypes. Building on the work of Lange and colleagues we
               develop an alternative method based on the principal component
               of heritability (PCH). For each SNP the PCH approach reduces the
               phenotypes to a single trait that has a higher heritability than
               any other linear combination of the phenotypes. As a result, the
               association between a SNP and derived trait is often easier to
               detect than an association with any of the individual phenotypes
               or the PCP. When applied to unrelated subjects, PCH has a
               drawback. For each SNP it is necessary to estimate the vector of
               loadings that maximize the heritability over all phenotypes. We
               develop a method of iterated sample splitting that uses one
               portion of the data for training and the remainder for testing.
               This cross-validation approach maintains the type I error
               control and yet utilizes the data efficiently, resulting in a

              have extended traditional approaches to direct and indirect

              inference are further extended to settings in which multiple
              mediators may be of interest. Two analytic approaches, one based
              on regression and one based on weighting are proposed to estimate
              the effect mediated through multiple mediators and the effects
              through other pathways. The approaches proposed here accommodate
              exposure-mediator interactions and, to a certain extent,
              mediator-mediator interactions as well. The methods handle binary
              or continuous mediators and binary, continuous or count outcomes.
              When the mediators affect one another, the strategy of trying to
              assess direct and indirect effects one mediator at a time will in
              general fail; the approach given in this paper can still be used.

              of increasing interest to identify eGenes, the genes whose
              expression levels are associated with variation at a particular
              genetic variant. Detecting eGenes is important for follow-up
              analyses and prioritization because genes are the main entities
              in biological processes. To detect eGenes, one typically focuses
              on the genetic variant with the minimum p value among all
              variants in cis with a gene and corrects for multiple testing to
              obtain a gene-level p value. For performing multiple-testing
              correction, a permutation test is widely used. Because of growing
              sample sizes of eQTL studies, however, the permutation test has
              become a computational bottleneck in eQTL studies. In this paper,
              we propose an efficient approach for correcting for multiple
              testing and assess eGene p values by utilizing a multivariate
              normal distribution. Our approach properly takes into account the
              linkage-disequilibrium structure among variants, and its time
              complexity is independent of sample size. By applying our
              small-sample correction techniques, our method achieves high
              accuracy in both small and large studies. We have shown that our
              method consistently produces extremely accurate p values

               ``regulatory hotspots,'' resulting in ``trans-regulatory bands''
               in an eQTL map. As several recent studies have demonstrated,
               technical confounding factors such as batch effects can
               complicate eQTL analysis by causing many spurious associations

              method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular
              mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The
              approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by

  author    = "Bowden, Jack and Davey Smith, George and Burgess, Stephen",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses
               including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly
               increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide
               association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise
               estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may
               not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them
               having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).
               METHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple
               instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by
               pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias.
               Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually
               by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger
               regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis,
               can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope
               coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the
               causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each
               genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the
               pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure),
               Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis
               and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the
               genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables. RESULTS: We
               illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two
               published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect
               of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood
               pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative
               nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.
               CONCLUSIONS: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call
               MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard
               instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect
               estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach
               provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the
               findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.",

              idea of meta-analysis which aggregates results of multiple
              genome-wide association studies to improve the power to detect
              associations. In principle, meta-analysis methods can be used to
              combine results from multiple tissues. However, eQTLs may have
              effects in only a single tissue, in all tissues, or in a subset
              of tissues with possibly different effect sizes. This
              heterogeneity in terms of effects across multiple tissues
              presents a key challenge to detect eQTLs. In this paper, we
              develop a framework that leverages two popular meta-analysis
              methods that address effect size heterogeneity to detect eQTLs
              across multiple tissues. We show by using simulations and
              multiple tissue data from mouse that our approach detects many
              eQTLs undetected by traditional eQTL methods. Additionally, our
              method provides an interpretation framework that accurately
              predicts whether an eQTL has an effect in a particular tissue.",

               Here, we introduce a method for estimating the local genetic
               correlation between gene expression and a complex trait and
               utilize it to estimate the genetic correlation due to predicted
               expression between pairs of traits. We integrated gene
               expression measurements from 45 expression panels with summary
               GWAS data to perform 30 multi-tissue transcriptome-wide
               association studies (TWASs). We identified 1,196 genes whose
               expression is associated with these traits; of these, 168 reside
               more than 0.5 Mb away from any previously reported GWAS

               Results from twin, family and adoption studies are consistent
               with general intelligence being highly heritable and genetically
               stable throughout the life course. No robustly associated

               from 17[thinsp]989 individuals in six discovery and three
               replication samples. Although no individual single-nucleotide
               polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected with genome-wide

               significantly associated gene for adult intelligence, was also
               significantly associated with childhood intelligence (P=0.003).
               Polygenic prediction analyses resulted in a significant

               1000 Genomes) is a widely used approach for increasing power in
               genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis. Existing
               hidden Markov models (HMM)-based imputation approaches require
               individual-level genotypes. Here, we develop a new method for
               Gaussian imputation from summary association statistics, a type
               of data that is becoming widely available. RESULTS: In
               simulations using 1000 Genomes (1000G) data, this method
               recovers 84\% (54\%) of the effective sample size for common
               (>5\%) and low-frequency (1-5\%) variants [increasing to 87\%
               (60\%) when summary linkage disequilibrium information is
               available from target samples] versus the gold standard of 89\%
               (67\%) for HMM-based imputation, which cannot be applied to
               summary statistics. Our approach accounts for the limited sample
               size of the reference panel, a crucial step to eliminate
               false-positive associations, and it is computationally very
               fast. As an empirical demonstration, we apply our method to
               seven case-control phenotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case
               Control Consortium (WTCCC) data and a study of height in the
               British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC). Gaussian imputation from
               summary statistics recovers 95\% (105\%) of the effective sample
               size (as quantified by the ratio of [Formula: see text]
               association statistics) compared with HMM-based imputation from
               individual-level genotypes at the 227 (176) published single
               nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the WTCCC (1958BC height)
               data. In addition, for publicly available summary statistics
               from large meta-analyses of four lipid traits, we publicly
               release imputed summary statistics at 1000G SNPs, which could
               not have been obtained using previously published methods, and
               demonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the data. We
               show that 1000G imputation using our approach increases the
               magnitude and statistical evidence of enrichment at genic versus
               non-genic loci for these traits, as compared with an analysis
               without 1000G imputation. Thus, imputation of summary statistics
               will be a valuable tool in future functional enrichment

               the variability in the local genetic structure across

               association at these loci, have been successfully identified.
               Current statistical methods for identifying causal variants at
               risk loci either use the strength of the association signal in
               an iterative conditioning framework or estimate probabilities
               for variants to be causal. A main drawback of existing methods
               is that they rely on the simplifying assumption of a single
               causal variant at each risk locus, which is typically invalid at
               many risk loci. In this work, we propose a new statistical
               framework that allows for the possibility of an arbitrary number
               of causal variants when estimating the posterior probability of
               a variant being causal. A direct benefit of our approach is that

               variants with a high confidence level (e.g., 95\%) even when the

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies, which typically report
              regression coefficients summarizing the associations of many
              genetic variants with various traits, are potentially a powerful
              source of data for Mendelian randomization investigations. We
              demonstrate how such coefficients from multiple variants can be
              combined in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the
              causal effect of a risk factor on an outcome. The bias and
              efficiency of estimates based on summarized data are compared to
              those based on individual-level data in simulation studies. We
              investigate the impact of gene\textbackslashtextendashgene
              interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and
              \textbackslashtextquoteleftweak
              instruments\textbackslashtextquoteright on these estimates. Both
              an inverse-variance weighted average of variant-specific
              associations and a likelihood-based approach for summarized data
              give similar estimates and precision to the two-stage least
              squares method for individual-level data, even when there are
              gene\textbackslashtextendashgene interactions. However, these
              summarized data methods overstate precision when variants are in
              linkage disequilibrium. If the P-value in a linear regression of
              the risk factor for each variant is less than
              1$\times$10\textbackslashtextminus5, then weak instrument bias
              will be small. We use these methods to estimate the causal
              association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on
              coronary artery disease using published data on five genetic
              variants. A 30\% reduction in LDL-C is estimated to reduce
              coronary artery disease risk by 67\% (95\% CI: 54\% to 76\%). We
              conclude that Mendelian randomization investigations using
              summarized data from uncorrelated variants are similarly
              efficient to those using individual-level data, although the
              necessary assumptions cannot be so fully assessed.",

               tested for association with all available phenotypes and traits
               that have been measured in study participants. By investigating
               the relationship between genetic variation and a diversity of
               phenotypes, there is the potential for uncovering novel
               relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
               phenotypes, and networks of interrelated phenotypes. PheWAS also
               can expose pleiotropy, provide novel mechanistic insights, and
               foster hypothesis generation. This approach is complementary to
               genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that test the association
               between hundreds of thousands, to over a million, single
               nucleotide polymorphisms and a single phenotype or limited
               phenotypic domain. The Population Architecture using Genomics
